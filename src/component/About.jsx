          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>My name is Alemayehu Mekonen. I am a skilled and experienced web developer from Ethiopia with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I have a deep understanding of programming concepts and an ability to apply them to my work as a web developer. I am well-versed in various web development technologies, including REACT, NODEJS, MONGODB, and more, which enables me to create and maintain websites and web-based applications with ease. I understand that user experience is key, and I put a lot of effort into making sure that the websites I develop are easy to navigate, visually appealing, and provide a seamless experience for the user. Whether it's a simple brochure website or a complex web application, my goal is to create something that is not only functional but also intuitive and easy to use.
